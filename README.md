# So, Why?

A Flutter + Firebase social media mobile app project, for HackMIT, that aims to improve communication through the why methodology.

## Idea

Improving communication through the why methodology to find the root problem.
We are creating a platform to encourage conversations with a methodology that seeks to thoroughly identify the cause of a problem.
Our goal is to create an environment with deeper topics, with deeper conversations, a place where people need to think hard before posting a topic. When we make our platform with deeper topics, then people should also respond to topics more deeply. 
A summary of the project: we are looking to use this methodology to make people with opposing opinions come to a consensus or just understand the other side.

Frontend is done with Flutter and Backend with Firebase.
